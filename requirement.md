*the following has been taken and copied from [Informit](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1152528&seqNum=4)*

A requirement needs to meet several criteria to be considered a “good requirement” [HUL05][LEF03] [LUD05][YOU01].
Good requirements should have the following characteristics:

* Unambiguous
* Testable (verifiable)
* Clear (concise, terse, simple, precise)
* Correct
* Understandable
* Feasible (realistic, possible)
* Independent
* Atomic
* Necessary
* Implementation-free (abstract)

Besides these criteria for individual requirements, three criteria apply to the set of requirements. The set should be

* Consistent
* Nonredundant
* Complete
