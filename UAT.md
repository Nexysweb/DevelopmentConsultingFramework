# User Acceptance Testing

## Reporting malfunctions

When reporting a (perceived) malfunction, useful are
- URL
- any sort of *relevant* metadata (specific parameter, previous page, state of the app, etc)
- screenshot, if it is a UI problem
- (sometimes) screenshot of the console logs


## Bugs vs new Features

* Bugs are malfunctions. The received output is not the one that was expected.
* Features are functionalities that one wishes were present/implemented but were not implemented yet.
