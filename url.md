### URL

A URL are made of different parts
* protocol: `https`, `https`
* subdomain: `app`
* host: `mydomain.com`
* path: `/my/path`
* query: `?p=1&q=2`

`uri` should not be used, it is officially deprecated.
 > Standardize on the term URL. URI and IRI are just confusing. In practice a single algorithm is used for both so keeping them distinct is not helping anyone. URL also easily wins the search result popularity contest.
